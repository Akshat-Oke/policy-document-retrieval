provide with respect to a "non-owned auto" or any
vehicle used as a temporary substitute for a vehicle
you own shall be excess over any other collectible
insurance.

they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by
any two will be binding. Each party will:
1. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
2. Bear the expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.
